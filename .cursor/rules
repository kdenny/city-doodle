# Rules

Read files before modifying them - understand existing code before making changes
Use existing patterns - match the codebase's style, naming conventions, and architecture
Prefer editing over creating - modify existing files rather than creating new ones
Keep changes minimal - only change what's necessary to complete the task
No security vulnerabilities - avoid XSS, SQL injection, command injection, etc.
Handle errors gracefully - don't leave code in broken states
Test your changes - verify code works before marking task complete
Document non-obvious code - add comments only where the logic isn't self-evident

# Avoid

Do not: Guessing file contents without reading them first
Do not: Creating new abstractions for one-time operations
Do not: Adding features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond what was asked
Do not: Over-engineering with unnecessary complexity
Do not: Leaving console.log or debug statements in production code
Do not: Ignoring existing error handling patterns
Do not: Making assumptions about requirements without asking
Do not: Committing secrets, API keys, or credentials
